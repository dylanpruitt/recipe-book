        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1/4</b> lb pasta</li>
            <li><b>1 1/2 oz.</b> cheese (without anti-caking agents)</li>
            <li><b>2</b> teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li><b>1/2</b> teaspoon salt</li>

        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <p>In sauce pot, combine pasta, salt, and 1 1/2 cups water.</p>
        <p>Place pot on oven and heat on high.</p>
        <p>Stir pasta occasionally. When water boils, start tracking the pasta cook time.</p>
        <p>In a bowl, combine 1 tsp. cornstarch and 2 tbsp. cold water. Stir to form slurry mix.</p>
        <p>On a cutting board, cut cheese into small pieces. Sprinkle 1 tsp. cornstarch over cheese, and
            mix until cheese is completely covered in cornstarch.
        </p>
        <p>If pasta water is evaporating too quickly, reduce heat and add 1/2 cup hot water to pot.</p>
        <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar">
            <p><i>This is the trickiest part about this recipe - it's easy to think you need to add more water than you have.
            </i></p>
        </div> 
        <p>Once pasta is done cooking, reduce to low. Stir slurry and add to pot. 
            Stir pot until slurry is thick (about 1 minute).</p>
        <p>Add cheese mix to pot, and turn heat to medium. Stir pot until cheese mix is thick (about 1 minute).</p>
        <p>Remove from heat and serve with pepper.</p>
