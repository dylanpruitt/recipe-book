# RECIPE BOOK (thinking of a better title)

I wanted to create a web app that I can use from my laptop and phone as a recipe book, to get experience with responsive web design.

Eventual features:
- Responsive web design optimized for mobile
- Allowing users to upload/edit their own recipes

Test out the app [here](https://rwd-test-drive.surge.sh/search.html)! This is only a static site, but before I get anything with databases setup, this will have the most up-to-date content.
